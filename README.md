# qemu_snapshot_vs_overlay_wiki
this shall become a wiki page that explains the difference between snapshaots and overlay (copy-on-write) images in qemu

it't meant to correct the existing http://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/CreateSnapshot   (which is not accurate). Also it should clarify what the differences between snapshots and c-o-w images are and how they can be used
