# qemu_snapshot_vs_overlay_wiki
this shall become a wiki page that explains the difference between snapshots and overlay (copy-on-write) images in qemu

I intend to add this to the official wiki pages if it will be accepted  http://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/CreateSnapshot   
especially   http://wiki.qemu.org/Documentation/CreateSnapshot   (which is not accurate) needs to be improved. 

I intend to clarify what the differences between snapshots and overlay (cow) images and how they can be used
